// So far in the application, queryData represents the JSON file obtained from a third-party API (right now,
// using www.quandl.com ). historicalData is a JSON file with the application data, it is obtained by taking the query
// results (queryData) and formatting it to our application's need. Our application will mainly access and work using
// historicalData, not queryData. queryData is only used to populate historicalData in a more convenient format.
